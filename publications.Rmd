### Other Projects

##### Association of Bayesian Go/No-Go Design in Early Oncology Studies
This is a project completed during my internship at Bristol Myers Squibb. It is a 
[shiny app](https://amypitts.shinyapps.io/go_nogo_early_oncology_studies/) that explores how the Simon's Two-Phase Design can be adapted to a dual criterion Bayesian design.

##### Dose Escalation Methods
This is the second project that I completed during my time at Bristol Myers Squibb. I developed a 
[shiny app](https://amypitts.shinyapps.io/dose_escalation_app/) that compares 11 different dose escalation methods through user specified simulations. It also compares decision tables for the methods that can be summarized into one. 

##### Missing Data in Cancer Studies.
