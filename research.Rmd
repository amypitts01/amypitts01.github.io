## Interesting Projects
This is home to a complication of projects I have done throughout my academic career.

##### Exploration in US Beer Data. 
This final project for a data science class is an interactive [website](https://iriswangziyi.github.io/p8105_final_project/index.html) that dives into how Beer consumption, production and taxation difference between each state. 

##### Missing Data in Cancer Studies. 
View an interactive visualization of how missing data introduce bias in my [Shiny App](https://amypitts.shinyapps.io/Missing_Data/)! 

##### Finding Time Series Breakpoints with Fully Connected Neural Networks
Here is the published [paper](https://csce.ucmss.com/cr/books/2019/LFS/CSREA2019/ICA4059.pdf)!
