I am a Biostatistics PhD candidate at Columbia University, enrolled in the Mailman School of Public Health. My research interests revolve around causal inference, missing data, and Bayesian statistics. Currently, I am actively involved in organizing the Computing Club, where we hold biweekly meetings during the fall and spring academic semesters. For more information about our organization and the diverse range of topics we cover, please visit our [website](http://cu-biostats-computing-club.org/)! 

In May 2020, I obtained my B.S. degree from Marist College, where I pursued a double major in Applied Mathematics and Data Analytics, with a minor in Computer Science. I graduated Summa Cum Laude, honors in the mathematics major and was honored with a Bachelorate award in Mathematics. Throughout my time at Marist, I held leadership positions such as President of the Association for Women in Mathematics chapter and Pi Mu Epsilon chapter. Additionally, I served as the Vice-President of the Marist Math Club and held the role of treasurer within the Marist College Equestrian team.
